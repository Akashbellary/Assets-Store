# 3DAssetStore [3DMarket]

[NOTE: This isn't the actual site I will be using for production. This is just a simple site for demonstration purposes, though the UI is the same.]

This project is aimed at building a 3D asset store for the 3D Modeller community I'm part of. Our community is small, but we make high-quality content. The main goal of this project was to master HTML, Tailwind CSS while working on something that will be used in production. The site will be hosted very soon, and any 3D modelling artist can sell his 3D arts on the site. As i am a freelancer 3D Artist too, I am trying to fix issues 3D artists face with selling their 3D Models.

## Used Tools

- **Frontend:** HTML and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Django

## Features

- **Home Screen:** Showcases all the assets available.
- **Sign In & Sign Up:** Fully functional authentication system built with Django's auth features.
- **Account Management:** After creating an account, you can add new 3D models you built and delete existing ones in your account.
- **Contact Artists:** Buy and sell 3D models by contacting other artists.
- **Search Option:** Search assets by typing related texts (e.g., searching "firearm" will list guns even if they have different titles by considering the text in the product description).
- **Category Option:** Choose 3D models from different categories.

## Project Structure
